# Alien-Invasion
This game, Alien Invasion, is created after the popular "Space Invaders". Most of the code here is from Eric Matthes' "Python Crash Course", though I have added  some gameplay and aesthetic changes.

Aesthetic Changes:
* Added a Game Over Button
* Changed background color
* Changed Font
* Changed ship, now is a vaccine.
* Changed the aliens, now they are covid-19 virus.

The only major game play changes include:
* Enemies are now able to shoot back
* Reduced the number of lives by one to make gameplay more challenging
* Added a feature that saves the high score so it isn't reset each time you start the game



## Game Description
  
Python 3 is required.

>To move the ship right or left, use the corresponding arrow keys and shoot bullets using the spacebar. When the game begins, a fleet of aliens appears at the top and >moves across and down the screen. After each fleet is destroyed, a new fleet appears that will be faster than the previous one. Once an alien reaches the bottom of >the screen, or hits the player's ship with a bullet, then the player loses a ship. Once the player loses all his ships, the game is over.
